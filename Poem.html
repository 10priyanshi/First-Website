        <p> 
        Saw cotton candy of many shapes<br>
        When once my smile was not fake<br>
        Were floating high & white took pink's place<br>    
        How cool will it be if they reach space<br>
        Cause i was just a little girl<br>
        Unknown of the twist and turns
    </p>
        
        <p>
            Taught me to dream every day<br>
            Why i thought i am gonna slay<br>
            How did they reach up there made me woder<br>
            Did they get angry & thus they thunder<br>
            Cause i was just watching the sky <br>
            Unknown of who is hungry up high<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I still look up at that blue vastness<br>
            But cotton candy isn't anymore my guess<br>
            Time lapsed to change my inner self<br>
            Unable get over the thunder infact<br>
            Cause i am not alittle girl anymore<br>
            Unknown or forgot how to love & adore<br>
        </p>
